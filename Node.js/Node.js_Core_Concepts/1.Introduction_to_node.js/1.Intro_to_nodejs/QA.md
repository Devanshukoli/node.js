## What is concurrent connections in general?

-Concurrent connections refer to the number of simultaneous connections that can be established between a client and a server. In the context of web servers, concurrent connections usually refer to the number of clients that can connect to a server and request data at the same time.
-A web server's capacity to handle concurrent connections depends on various factors, including the server's hardware specifications, the network infrastructure, and the server software. A server with higher processing power and memory can handle more concurrent connections than a server with lower specifications. Similarly, a network with high bandwidth can handle more concurrent connections than a network with lower bandwidth.
- The number of concurrent connections that a server can handle is an important metric for web applications that experience high traffic or require real-time communication. If the server is not able to handle the number of concurrent connections, it can lead to slow loading times, dropped connections, and poor user experience.
- To improve the capacity for handling concurrent connections, web developers often use techniques such as load balancing, caching, and optimizing server software configurations. They may also use tools like connection pooling, which allows multiple client connections to share a single connection to the server, reducing the overall load on the server.

## can you just give me overview of utility folder that people create in the node.js project. What does utitlity mean in context to  node.js.? Why we need? If  i dont use utility folder, then is it ok?

- The utility folder in a Node.js project is not a built-in folder or module in Node.js. It is a convention that some developers use to organize utility functions and modules in their project.
- In general, the term "utility" refers to code or functionality that is useful but doesn't fit neatly into a specific category or module. It is often used to refer to helper functions, modules, or classes that provide generic functionality that can be reused across different parts of an application.
- The use of an utility folder or module in a Node.js project is not mandatory, but it can be useful for organizing and reusing common functions and modules across different parts of the application. It can help to reduce code duplication and improve the maintainability of the project.
- If you choose not to use an utility folder or module in your project, you can still organize and reuse common functions and modules in other ways, such as creating separate modules for related functionality or using a shared library or dependency.
- Any module that is helpful in simplifying tasks that you'll encounter in Node.js. For example:

- Utility libraries (Lodash, Underscore) that help simplify common operations
- Single purpose libraries (Moment, node-fetch) that solve a problem particularly well

- In summary, the utility folder in a Node.js project is a convention that some developers use to organize and reuse common functions and modules. It is not mandatory, but it can help to improve the maintainability of the project and reduce code duplication.
